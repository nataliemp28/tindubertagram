<h1>Trail - Project 3</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This was our final group project at WDI and I was in a team of four. The project brief was to build a full stack Single Page App using Node and MongoDB on the back and and AngularJS on the front end. We built a travel blogging app, enabling users to track their travels via either photo blogs or written blogs. Users can also follow other users and like their posts.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<p>NodeJS, Mongoose, MongoDB, Google Maps API, AngularJS, HTML5, SCSS, Bootstrap, Bourbon, Trello, Sketch, Git/Github</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project was a similar back-end setup to what we had used previously but we were using AngularJS on the front end, this gave us the opportunity to utilise the scope of Angular and create a single page app with full CRUD actions. We also learned how to use Google Maps API with Angular and also incorporated further authentication by building login with Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>We came up with our idea really quickly on this group project as we all wanted to go in a similar direction. We then decided to do our wireframes in Sketch, for two of us in the group this was a new tool so it was a good opportunity to learn it. We planned out our user journey and experience really thoroughly before we started coding. We then moved onto the Node back end, setting up the authentication for users and for login with Facebook and Instgram, once this was set up we proceeded to the front end, using AngularJS, this is what took the bulk of the time. We spent a fair amount of time on getting our styling right and incorporated pure CSS parallax scrolling on the home page. We also had to add in the Google Maps API in order for users to be able to view their trips.</p>

<h2>What Next</h2>

<p>We need to add in the ability for users to delete their profile as currently this is not available. We also really wanted to build in a share on Facebook feature to enable users to share posts on Facebook.</p>
