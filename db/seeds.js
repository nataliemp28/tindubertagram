<p>This viaduct was built at Gotuwala between the two railway stations – Ella and Demodara during the British Colonial period is the largest in Sri Lanka. Located almost 3100 feet above the sea level, this 99.6ft high bridge is called “Ahas namaye palama” (Nine skies bridge) in Sinhala. When one stands underneath it and looks up there is a beautiful sight of ‘nine skies’ through the nine arches, hence the Sinhala name. This bridge is also called ‘The Bridge in the sky’ due to the sheer height. This massive bridge is built entirely of solid rocks, bricks and cement without using a single piece of steel. The bridge was finally commissioned in 1921. There is a popular story to say that when construction work was commenced on the bridge, the World War 1 broke-out and the steel consignment assigned for this site was seized and was used for war related projects. When the work came to a standstill the locals came forward and build the bridge with solid stone bricks and cement without steel.

<h1>Day Two- Tea Plantations</h1>
<p>Another district in the Central Province is Nuwara Eliya, best known for its tea. Due to its geo climatic attributes, Nuwara Eliya is known to produce tea of particularly fine quality. With the highest altitudes at over 6,000 ft, cool climes, and moderate rainfall the region possesses a highly conducive environment for tea cultivation. There are two seasons that arrive here namely the eastern and the western, and the climatic conditions vary from one estate to another although located short drives apart. The liqueur produced from unusually small leaves characteristic of the region, is the lightest among the regionals varieties. Among the several grades produced from Nuwara Eliya the most popular is the whole-leaf orange pekoe (OP).

<p> Our second hike in Ella was to Little Adam\`s Peak, which we did in between the two longer ones. We did this trip without a guide. It is a fairly easy hike and the path is market by signs so it\`s easy to find, and very popular among tourists! So expect to meet many other people from all over the world on this trip! On the two other more remote trips we did in Ella, we hardly met anybody, just some locals now and then. The Little Adam\'s Peak. it\`s named after it\`s big brother, the holy mountain Adam\`s Peak, because of the similar shape. Adam\`s Peak is further west in Sri Lanka, close to Nuwara Eliya, and is 2243 m high and a much more exhausting and more challenging climb! The mountain has however three names; Adam\`s Peak (this is where Adam first set foot on earth after being cast out of heaven), Sri Pada (Buddha\`s footprint left by the Buddha as he headed towards paradise) and Samanalakande (Butterfly mountain, where butterflies go to die). We had plans of climbing Big Adams Peak, but Espen hurt his knee so we settled for the “little brother” instead.</p>`,
